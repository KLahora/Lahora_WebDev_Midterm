    <h1>Nostalgia</h1>

    <br>I miss the <em>old</em> times
    <br>Times of <em>genuine</em> happiness
    <br><em>Fragrance</em> of sweat tearing down our chests
    <br>The time of it when i was I <em>kid</em>
    <br><strong>Oh</strong> I long for those days
    <br>
    <br>Now I'm still young but feel like I'm <em>old</em>
    <br>Reminiscing the past of what I <strong>could </strong>  
    <br>I wish to turn back the <em>time</em> and   
    <br>See myself, enjoying life as it <strong>should </strong>
