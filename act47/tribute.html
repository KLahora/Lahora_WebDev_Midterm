<p>Kobe Bryant, the 18-time All-Star who won five NBA championships and became one of the greatest basketball players of his generation </p>
<p>during a 20-year career with the Lakers, died in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26, 2020. He was 41. Also killed in the crash was Bryant's </p>
<p>13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others who were on board the aircraft.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Bryant became one of the NBA's most popular players and the face of the Lakers during his career. Winning a record four NBA All-Star </p>
<p>Game MVP awards, he was the overall league MVP in 2008, a two-time NBA scoring champion and 12 All-Defensive selections.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>He teamed with Shaquille O'Neal in a combustible partnership to lead the Lakers to NBA titles in 2000, 2001 and 2002. He later teamed </p>
<p>with Pau Gasol to win two more titles in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>A two-time Olympic gold medalist with the dominant U.S. team, Bryant retired in 2016 after scoring 60 points in his final NBA game. </p>
<p>In December 2017, the Lakers hung banners retiring his No. 8 and No. 24 jerseys in the Staples Center rafters in an unprecedented </p>
<p>double honor.</p>
